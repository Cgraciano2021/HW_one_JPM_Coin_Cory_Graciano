OverView 
- J.P Morgan Chase & Co. Bank is a multinational investment bank who is U.S top bank when it comes to total assests. This may be due to JP Morgan targeting digital savy customers and introducing artificial intellingene products, including the JPM Coin. JPM Coin is digital currency to help instantly transfer money between JP Morgans clients. 

Business Activites 

- JPM Coin allows institutional clients of JP Morgan Chase to transfer money instantly over a blockchain ledger, which in this case is Quorum, and complete the transaction instantly and more efficient than a traditional transaction.
- Due to the JPM Coin still being in its testing phase, it is currently only designed for business to busines transfers for instituational clients. 
- J.P Morgan Chase Bank is the first of ***Big Banks*** in the U.S to do anything that involves anything similar to crytocurrencies, which will give them the experience in the game before any of its major competitors and will allow them to offer their clients a feature they can't get anywhere else.
- JPM Coin is a digital coin with the backiing of the government US dollar which makes it different than any cryptocurrencies as well. 
- J.P Morgan Chase first developed their own in house blockchain private network called Quorum, which is their own permissioned verision of Ethereum Technology.This allows them to keep transactions and names of parties private from the public. 
- J.P Morgan recently handed over Quorum rights to a software company, ConsenSys, which they invested and is ran by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin.

Landscape
- JPM Coin is considered to be in the Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies market but with the backing of the nations largest banks it can start moving into other financial industries in the future. 
- The biggest trend in the past couple years which will helped set the path for JPM Coin is mobile technology. With J.P Morgan understanding this, the have invested heavily in banking technology and boost the biggest tech budget of all banks in 2019 with $11.4 billion.

Results
- JPM Coin is still in its testing phase so there isnt much infomration on current results of the new technology.

Recommendations
- With no other banks attempting to do anything similiar or crytos not having the backing of the largest bank, this allows JP Morgan take their time when it comes to JPM coin.
- ALlow them to focus on security when it comes to clients accounts becuase JP Morgan being heavily invested in Ethereum, a situation similar to [The DAO Hack](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao) would be detrimental.
- If JP Morgan can create a platform where Chase clients can exchange cryptos but have it depsoited instantly into their banking accounts, I believe this will allow JPM Coin to skyrocket.
- First they will need to give retail clients permission to use JPM Coin, then this will allow JPM Coin to skyrocket in my opinion due to the amount of people who trade crypto. Greg Iacurci states more than 1 out of 10 Americans traded cryptos in the past year.
- Increase in technology and targeting the 13% of Americans who traded cryptos in the past year can increase the already largest US Bank.
